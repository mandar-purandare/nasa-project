Node.js NASA Mission Control Final Project

This is a demo project that is used for scheduling SpaceX rocket launches to exoplanets. (for their customers like NASA)  

(habitable exoplanets are planets outside our solar system that have a solar flux less than 1.11 and more than 0.36 times that of earth and planet radius < 1.6 times that of earth)  


Using this application we can:
Schedule new rocket launches
Abort Missions
View upcoming and aborted missions  


The application is built using the following technologies and middleware:  
Node.js  
Express.js  
Mongo Atlas  
Mongoose  
React.js  
Morgan  
cors
